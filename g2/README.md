# The Gauntlet

I Found this repo from https://github.com/aidielse/ . This is a great repo to practice pwn challenges.

*moved all of aidielse solves into respected folders*

This is an organized list of cream-of-the-crop pwning challenges that have come out in ctf's over the past few years.

I went through this [list](https://pastebin.com/uyifxgPu) and tracked down every binary that I could.

## Recommended Training

It is highly recommended that you work your way through the following material (in order) before you tackle the gauntlet.

1. [Modern Binary Exploitation](https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE), [website_link_here](http://security.cs.rpi.edu/courses/binexp-spring2015/)
2. [Malware Analysis](https://github.com/RPISEC/Malware)
3. [HITCON-Training](https://github.com/scwuaptx/HITCON-Training)

## Useful Resources

Here are some resources to help you out as you go through the gauntlet.

1. Linux Heap Exploitation
    * [Sploitfun](https://sploitfun.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/understanding-glibc-malloc/)
